## Installation

To install SpectralPalette, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system (visit the Rust installation guide for instructions).
2. Install the CUDA or OpenCL toolkit, depending on your GPU architecture.
3. Clone the SpectralPalette repository using `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/SpectralPalette.git`.
4. Navigate to the repository root and run `cargo build` to build the library.
5. Run `cargo test` to validate the installation and ensure the library is functioning correctly.

## Configuration

SpectralPalette exposes several environment variables to customize the color palette generation process:

* `SPECTRAL_PALETTE_COLOR_SPACE`: Specify the color space for palette generation (e.g., RGB, HEX, XYZ).
* `SPECTRAL_PALETTE_PERCEPTUAL_MODEL`: Select the perceptual color model to use (e.g., CIECAM02, CIELAB, CIELUV).
* `SPECTRAL_PALETTE_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD`: Set the entropy threshold for optimizing color palettes.

## Usage

To generate a color palette using SpectralPalette, simply create an instance of the `SpectralPalette` struct and call the `generate_palette` method:

This code snippet generates a 5-color palette in the RGB color space using the CIECAM02 perceptual color model.
